# Cell-Detection-and-Tracking
Python FCNN for detecting and tracking cells

A Fully Convolutional Neural Network to predict a spatial density map, that can simultaneously detect and and count cells in crowded scenes. Additionally includes a tracking algorithm which displays the lineage tree of cells across time-lapse frames.
However, further research into improving the tracking algorithm and analysing individual cell morphology is required.
